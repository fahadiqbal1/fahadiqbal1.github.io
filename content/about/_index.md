Hello and welcome to my little corner of the internet! My name, as you can probably guess, is Fahad and I am a Pakistani-American who works in FinTech out of Denver, Colorado. I absolutely love solving problems using unique and creative solutions and I greatly enjoy learning new things and new ways of doing things. Over the years, I have also been fortunate enough to live and work all over the globe and have had the opportunity to travel the world and experience a whole host of different cultures and cuisines. To see what I am up to, please visit my [now](/now) page, which I keep up to date pretty frequently.
