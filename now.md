Currently I am living it up in London, UK. Though I make the occasional trip back home to Houston, TX (espcially for Eid). I am also getting ready for my upcoming wedding :couple:. Still working for the same company as before, though I travel a lot more than I did before and have travelled to quite a few places in the last 2-3 years.

Current projects:

* Soul Medicine
* Diving into some Machine Learning
* Sophworks

Upcoming travel plans:

* Just ask [these guys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes)
